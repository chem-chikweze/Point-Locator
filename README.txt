HOW THE CODE RUNS
***********************************************************

The code is run using the Main.java file.
The main method contains all the points already so you do not need to input anything. You 
just have to click run and the output will be shown for you.

HURDLES
***********************************************************
The bulk of the time we spent on the program involved checking wherher a pair of points 
are seperated by a line. It took a lot of time but we were able to develop solutions to it.
Towards the end of the coding exercise, we thought we would spend a lot of time on getting the
number of external nodes but we ended up modifying the pathlength function to solve it.
